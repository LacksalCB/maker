# maker
Small project to dynamically generate C/C++ makefiles.  Also allows users to save created makefiles and retrieve them later.  To be integrated into a greater program suite to automate/simplify the process of initializing a director for development. 

## Creator
 - Lacksal 
 - I only made this because I am looking to simplify my development process and I end up spending a good deal of time setting up my environment for each project, so I decided to take a stab at automating as much of it as possible.
